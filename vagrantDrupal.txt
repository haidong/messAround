Vagrant is a popular and useful program to help people create and manage VMs for dev, test, and sandbox purposes. This short document details steps needed to set up a Drupal dev VM based on Vagrant base box Precise64.

Prerequisite:
1. Vagrant installed on your host machine. For directions on how to set up Vagrant, go to <a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com/">this url</a>;
2. Install and set up VirtualBox. For directions, go to <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">this url</a>;
3. Create a base box for vagrant. This will serve as a base to create your own VMs. I choose to use precise64, which I think is good base
vagrant box add base http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
4. cd ~
5. mkdir drupal
6. cd drupal
7. vagrant init
8. Edit and save the file called Vagrant. Specifically, you need to do the following 2 things:
a. Edit the line that has the "config.vm.box = ", and put:
"precise64"
after the equal sign. As of this writing, that is line 10 in Vagrant file.
b. Uncomment the line that has "config.vm.network :forwarded_port: 80". As of this writing, it is line 19.

Now run the VM by running:
vagrant up

Once the VM is up, go there by running
vagrant ssh

VM setup for Drupal development. All commands below are supposed to be run on the VM.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install apache2
git clone --branch 8.x http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git
sudo apt-get install php5
sudo apt-get install php5-gd
sudo apt-get install php5-mysql
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo a2enmod userdir
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
mkdir ~/public_html
Edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file and add the following section after the section for /var/www/

        <Directory /home/*/public_html/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>
Edit /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf and comment out this section so it looks like this:
    # To re-enable php in user directories comment the following lines
    # (from <IfModule ...> to </IfModule>.) Do NOT set it to On as it
    # prevents .htaccess files from disabling it.
#    <IfModule mod_userdir.c>
#        <Directory /home/*/public_html>
#            php_admin_value engine Off
#        </Directory>
#    </IfModule>

mv ~/drupal/ ~/public_html/
sudo chgrp -R www-data ~/public_html/
sudo service apache2 restart

Now go to:
http://localhost:8080/~vagrant/drupal/

At this point, the only problem I have is:

The settings file does not exist.
The Drupal installer requires that you create a settings file as part of the installation process. Copy the ./sites/default/default.settings.php file to ./sites/default/settings.php. More details about installing Drupal are available in INSTALL.txt.

cp ~/public_html/drupal/sites/default/default.settings.php ~/public_html/drupal/sites/default/settings.php

sudo chgrp -R www-data ~/public_html/

so I followed the instruction above and created the settings.php file. And did:
http://localhost:8080/~vagrant/drupal/

I was then able to config and get Drupal running!
